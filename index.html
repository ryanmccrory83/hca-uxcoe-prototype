<!-- This is a first time use for many of the technologies used by your company. It was
fun getting to learn grid as I was taught to use flexbox for placement of elements and 
I think grid makes it so much easier for placement once you learn the nitty gritty of the 
beast. There's no need to constantly set margins between elements due to the use of grid gap.

Using Bootstrap and all the other dependencies locally rather than using CDN's or through 
the use of webpacks in the Vue.js frameworks has made it a challenge.-->

    those script files are read, bootstrap can become fully functional. After that, the index.js file is read and
